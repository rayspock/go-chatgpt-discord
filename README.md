## Features

- [x] **[Slash Command]**
    - Use `/chat` command to send a message to the bot in public channels, and it will respond with a
      message generated
      by the ChatGPT API.
- [x] **[Direct Message]**
    - Send private messages to the bot, and it will respond with a message generated by the ChatGPT API. This is useful for users who want to interact with the bot without broadcasting their messages to the whole server.
    - The responses generated by ChatGPT are streamed in real time so that users can see the progress of the completion. This is particularly useful for chat applications in which the user doesn't have to wait for a long time to see the result.

## Installation

To run this bot, please follow these steps:

1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/rayspock/go-chatgpt-discord/releases) and download the binary that
   matches your operating system. Extract the binary to a directory of your choice (such as `~/go-chatgpt-discord`).
1. In the same directory as the binary, create a copy of `env.example` and name it `.env` Fill in the appropriate
   credentials as directed.
1. Obtain a new OpenAI API key by following the link [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Then, fill
   in `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
1. Set up your Discord application and add a bot from
   the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications):

    - Fill out `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` with your Discord bot token from the Bot settings page.
    - Copy your "Client ID" from the OAuth2 tab and fill in `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`.

1. Check that the installation worked: `chmod +x go-chatgpt-discord && ./go-chatgpt-discord`
1. Run the bot by executing `./go-chatgpt-discord`. A bot invitation URL will appear in the console. Copy and paste this
   URL into your web browser to add the bot to your server.
1. Enable **direct messages** from other members of your server by going to the "Privacy Settings" page of your server
   and enabling "Allow direct messages from server members".
1. You're all set! You can now use the bot in your server by typing `/chat` in any channel, or by sending a direct
   message to the bot.
